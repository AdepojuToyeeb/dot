This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, install the dependencies using Yarn or npm:

````bash
yarn install
# or
npm install

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
````

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.


### Design Decisions
- The application uses built-in React context apis for state management for simplicity. For larger applications, I would consider implementing a global state management solution like Redux.



### Areas for Improvement
- Implementing a more robust unit and integration tests to ensure reliability and maintainability.
- implement accessibility features to ensure all users can navigate and use the application effectively.
